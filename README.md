# PPublisher

PPublisher is a GTK3 application for "easily" creating PPUB (Portable PUBlication) files, as well as PPIX (Ppub IndeX) files. It was written in a few hours as quickly as possible and I really need to tidy up this application as well as the PyPPUB libary that this uses.

At some point I'll package this and the dependencies so you don't need to remotely read my mind to get it working...
